An AI weather application built with Javascript and React. It leverages the OpenAI API and [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) API to provide conversational text responses of the current weather in a location

Functionality:
- Accept text from users
- Determine their location using open AI's API and return a location string in the format (country,state,city) for US locations and (country,city) for non US locations
- Determine the Weather for that location by sending an API request to openweathermap.org
- Display temperature
- Describe the weather in a conversational tone using open AI's API

Currently a work in progress
Optimized for desktop at the moment
